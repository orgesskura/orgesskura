## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for reading my profile. My name is Orges. I have two years of experience as a software engineer at Smarkets, a sports trading company, where I significantly improved my technical abilities especially in Python, System Design, and different tooling like AWS, Grafana, Kafka etc. 

- Studied Computer Science at University of Edinburgh and graduated in 2022 with a first degree.
- I've operated my own marketing agency, gaining skills in advertising and business management.
- I'm very passionate about health and fitness; I make it a point to regularly visit the gym and also learn new sports - currently I am doing jiu-jitsu. 
- I highly value learning and am continually seeking to enhance my understanding and skills. Currently learning more about AI, Maths, and a bit of Physics.
