## Hi | Çkemi | Hola | Merhaba 👋

Thanks for reading my profile. My name is Orges. I have two years of experience as a software engineer at Smarkets, a sports trading company, where I significantly enhanced my technical skills, particularly in Python and Rust, system design, and various tools such as AWS, Grafana, and Kafka. Additionally, I independently and as part of a team developed fully functional applications.

- 📖 Studied Computer Science at University of Edinburgh and graduated in 2022 with a first degree.
- 🏢 Operated a dental marketing agency for a bit more than a year, gaining skills in advertising and business management.  I generated appointments for dental practices, helping them to scale effectively.
- 🤖 Worked on several AI projects including an AI podcast search engine.
- 💪 I'm very passionate about health and fitness; I make it a point to regularly visit the gym and also learn new sports - currently I am doing jiu-jitsu. 
- 👨🏻‍💻 I highly value learning and am continually seeking to enhance my understanding and skills. Currently learning more about Rust, AI, Maths, and a bit of Physics.
