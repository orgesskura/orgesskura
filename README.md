## Hi | Çkemi | Hola | Merhaba 👋

I have two years of experience as a software engineer at Smarkets, a sports trading company, where I primarily worked in Python and Rust creating low-latency systems that can ingest and process huge amounts of data.

- 📖 Studied Computer Science at University of Edinburgh and graduated in 2022 with a first-class degree.
- 🏢 Ran a dental marketing agency for a bit more than a year.  I generated appointments for dental practices, helping them to scale effectively.
- 🤖 Worked on several AI projects, including an IoT application using wearable sensors for human activity recognition and an AI podcast search engine.
- 💪 Regularly visit the gym and learn new sports - currently doing jiu-jitsu. 
- 👨🏻‍💻 Currently learning more about AI, Maths, and a bit of Physics.
